# NoCalorieApp
Applications for the HYF program


Hi there! My name is Ilias, and as someone who has long been interested in nutrition and weight loss, I‚Äôve often faced the challenges of strict diets.

Most nutritionists agree: creating a calorie deficit is essential for weight loss. But the reality is more complex. For example, if you don‚Äôt exercise, your body may first burn muscle instead of fat.

Also, focusing too much on calorie counting can lead to stress, binge eating, and even eating disorders.

This project focuses on a more mindful approach to food: not just tracking calories, but understanding what‚Äôs inside the food ‚Äî the proteins, fats, and carbs we consume.

What the app does
This is a lightweight tool to calculate macronutrients (proteins, fats, and carbohydrates) for a specific product ‚Äî without counting calories.
It uses the FatSecret API to get accurate nutrition data per 100 grams.

Features:

Enter a product name and weight (in grams)

Get the amount of proteins, fats, and carbs based on the entered weight

Display the results in a clean, readable table

üõ†Ô∏è Tech stack:

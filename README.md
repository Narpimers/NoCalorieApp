# No CalorieApp

## About the Project

Hi! I'm someone who struggles with extra weight and often goes on diets. Of course, I usually fail â€” but thatâ€™s another story.

If you ask a nutritionist how to lose weight, theyâ€™ll tell you one important thing:  
**You need a calorie deficit** â€” that means consuming fewer calories than your body uses. This helps your body burn fat instead of storing it.

But itâ€™s not always that simple. For example, if you donâ€™t exercise, your body might burn **muscle** before it starts burning **fat**.

So, in this project, I want to focus only on **food and nutrition**.

## Why Not Just Count Calories?

Thereâ€™s a problem with only counting calories:

- It can lead to **binge eating**  
- It can cause **self-aggression** when you "fail"  
- You may feel **hungry all the time**
- It can **hurt your health** and lead to stress

Thatâ€™s why itâ€™s better to focus on **mindful eating**.  
Your body needs the **right balance of protein, fats, and carbs** every day. If you eat balanced meals, you will probably:

- Feel more satisfied  
- Be less hungry  
- Stay healthier in the long term

With this app, you can:

- Enter the name of a product
